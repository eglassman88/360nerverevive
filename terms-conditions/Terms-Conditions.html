          <br><span style="font-weight: 700;">Links to Other Sites</span>
          <br>
          <br>This site may contain links and/or advertisements to other websites maintained by us in addition to links to websites maintained by unrelated companies and persons. An advertisement of, or link to, a non-Neuropathy Alliance website does not mean that we approve, endorse or accept any responsibility for that website, its content or use, or the use of products and services made available through such website.<br>
          <br>We are not responsible for the actions, content, accuracy, opinions expressed, privacy policies, products or services provided through these links or made available through these resources or appearing in such websites, nor for any damages or losses, directly or indirectly, caused or alleged to have been caused as a result of your use or reliance on such websites.<br>
          <br>Such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy, completeness or conformance with applicable laws and regulations by us. We do not make any representations whatsoever, or give any warranties of any kind, expressed, implied, or otherwise about other websites which you may access through this site, the content thereof, or the products and/or services made available through such websites. If you decide to leave our site and access these other websites, you do so at your own risk. All rules, policies (including privacy policies) and operating procedures of such websites will apply to you while on such websites.<br>
          <br><span style="font-weight: 700;">Exclusion of Liability</span>
          <br>
          <br>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws we, on behalf of our employees, agents, suppliers, and contractors, exclude AND DISCLAIM liability for any losses and expenses of whatever nature and howsoever arising including, without limitation, any direct, indirect, special, punitive, or consequential damages, loss of use, loss of data, loss caused by a virus, loss of income or profit, loss of or damage to property, claims of third parties, or other losses of any kind or character, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages or losses, arising out of or in connection with the use of this site or any site with which it is linked.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER BASIS.<br>
          <br>These Terms of Use give you specific legal rights and you may also have other rights which vary from country to country, and jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, or certain kinds of limitations or exclusions of liability, so the limitations &amp; exclusions set out in these Terms of Use may not apply to you. Other jurisdictions allow limitations and exclusions subject to certain conditions. In such a case the limitations and exclusions set out in these Terms of Use shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of such applicable jurisdictions. The limitations and exclusions set out in these Terms of Use are inapplicable within the State of Texas to the extent they disclaim liability for Neuropathy Alliance’ own negligent, willful, or intentional conduct, or violation of any clearly established duty owed by ​Nerve Revive to exercise reasonable care in preventing the unlawful acts of others.<br>
          <br><span style="font-weight: 700;">Your Indemnification Obligations</span>

          <br>Your indemnification obligation does not apply in the State of New Jersey for any claim, liability, loss, expense or demand, including legal fees, arising out of 360 Nerve Revives’ own negligence.<br>
          <br><span style="font-weight: 700;">Modification and Discontinuation</span>
          <br>
